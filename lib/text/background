   Can we say, "Dungeons and Droids?"

   At mining camp Minrith-42 on the world Rouse's Place Sigma, they dug too 
greedily and too deep.

   The magic that was unleashed corrupted the technology, rendering blasters and
other devices ineffective but giving the gift of magic to a select few. The
droids, many of them, became ... altered ... dangerous.

   Deeper, strange monsters began appearing, carrying magic with devastating 
powers.

   You have been sent as a mercenary salvage operator, to try and stop the 
invasion from another world as well as to find treasure for yourself.

   Well ... I mean it is that plus a chat room where things can try to kill you.
