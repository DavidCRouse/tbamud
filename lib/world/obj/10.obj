and has a stylized "R W" engraved on the side.

plant~
   The plant has several stalks with short branches filled with blue-green 
leaves. The bottom of the stalks become thicker and more bulbous at the point
where they enter the soil. At intervals, the stalks seem to move, even wihout
a breeze to move them.

stalk stalks~
   At the top of the plant, the stalks are about the width of a pen, at the 
base they are perhaps the size of two hands.

color, the leaves are also speckled with orange spots.
